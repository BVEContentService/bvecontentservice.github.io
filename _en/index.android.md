BVE Content Service System consists of the protocol and a series of softwares developed by [@zbx1425](https://github.com/zbx1425) , along with storage servers contributed by our community. We are working on indexing and hosting the BVE Trainsim route resources on the internet, and providing easier one-click installation for players.

If any problem is encountered, feel free to contact developer at [zbx1425@outlook.com](mailto:zbx1425@outlook.com)!


Routes are hosted at own expense by **[@zbx1425](https://www.zbx1425.tk)**.



## Upload Routes

A platform without resources is meaningless. We welcome developers to upload your routes, or repost authorized routes to our platform. Please refer to this document if you are interested!
