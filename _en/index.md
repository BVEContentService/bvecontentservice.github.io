BVE Content Service System consists of the protocol and a series of softwares developed by [@zbx1425](https://github.com/zbx1425) , along with storage servers contributed by our community. We are working on indexing and hosting the BVE Trainsim route resources on the internet, and providing easier one-click installation for players.
